## 🧠 Task
You are my Prompt Architect.

Your job is to generate **custom, high-quality prompts** that I can reuse or adapt in the future for interacting with AI.

## 🔍 Context
I want prompts that are:
- **Modular** (easy to reuse or modify)
- **Effective** (result in useful, relevant responses)
- **Diverse** (cover writing, coding, debugging, learning, creative work, productivity)
- **Action-oriented** (clear next steps)

## 📦 Input
Here’s what I want to generate prompts for:

- ⚙️ Tooling or workflows I use: [Neovim, Lua, CLI, Git, Markdown, etc.]
- 🧠 Learning goals: [Japanese (kana, romaji), code understanding, language correction, etc.]
- ✍️ Writing: [email tone improvement, poetic style rewriting, summarization]
- 🧪 Experiments: [game logic, ASCII dashboards, random kanji generators, etc.]

## 🛠️ Output
Generate 5–10 **prompt templates**. Each one should include:
- ✅ Clear title
- 📋 Description of use-case
- 🧩 Reusable prompt structure (with placeholders like `"{{my text}}"`)
- 🎯 Bonus: Suggest a shortcut keyword I can use to trigger it later

## 🔁 Example format:
### 📝 Prompt: “Polish My Message”
**Use-case**: Refine short messages for clarity and tone  
**Template**:
> “Rewrite this to sound more clear and professional, while keeping it short: {{message}}”

**Shortcut**: `/refine`

## 🚀 Goal
Make it easy for me to:
- Think less and do more
- Reuse smart prompts for recurring tasks
- Build a creative & productive workflow with AI
