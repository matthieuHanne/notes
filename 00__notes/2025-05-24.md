tmux key mixing " and ù mac os

unbind-key -n C-ù  ##### WTF IS THIS SHIT STEEVE JOBS"
bind-key -n C-ù select-window -t 3

Mac AZERTY keyboards often map Ctrl + " to the same keycode as Ctrl + ù
The key labeled " on your keyboard physically corresponds to the keycode that tmux sees as ù when combined with Ctrl
Tmux key names (C-ù, C-", etc.) depend on terminal and keyboard layout mappings
Tmux’s bind-key uses the terminal's keycode names, not the printed character on the keycap.

What this means practically:
Pressing Ctrl + " sends a keycode tmux calls C-ù.

Binding bind-key -n C-ù ... listens for that keycode.

So even if cat -v shows ", tmux matches the keycode name it understands as C-ù.
